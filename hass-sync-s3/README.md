# Home Assistant Add-on: Hass-backup-s3

## What is it for ?

The goal of this addon is to sync a Home Assistant source folder such as /config /ssl /backup /media with compatible s3 storage.

It use the aws cli for achieve that

This addon make a tar.gz of the source folder and upload it on your s3 bucket. After the tar.gz created locally will be deleted (attention for the docker architecture the tar.gz is deleted after some minutes, for this reason please wait almost 5 minutes before relaunch the addon otherwise you will have more than one file uploaded on the s4)

This addon is a run-once application, means that the addon will be stopped after his work (tar gz and upload)

## How to use it ?

Call this addon from your backup automations to trigger it :

```yaml
- alias: Snapshot Once A Week
  trigger:
    - platform: time
      at: '10:00:00'
  condition:
    - condition: time
      weekday:
        - wed
  action:
    - service: hassio.addon_start
      data:
        addon: "053c5ba4_hass_sync_s3" -> Note this name can be chage so check on the Developers Tools/Service for the right name see below
```
![Developer Tools Service](images/devtoolshassaddon.png)

The service *hassio.addon_start* needs the addon slug to work. This is a concatenation of the first 8 char SHA1 hash of the repo url (lowercased) and the addon slug. If I ommit to update this part, you can check by yourself the hash part by taking the first 8 char of the hash here http://www.sha1-online.com/ filling "https://github.com/rbillon59/home-assistant-addons" in the form. It should not happen as the addons repository URL should not change. But in case of ..

You can also launch it manually with the start button in the addon page !


[comment]: <> ## If you need to restore the backup

[comment]: <> Just change the Option: `restore` and set it to true and launch the addon manually. It will download the last available backup of your snapshots.

[comment]: <> :warning: Please, think about setting the restore option to false after restoring your backups, or every time you will call it from [comment]: <> your automation it will restore the backups in your buckets and not upload it.
